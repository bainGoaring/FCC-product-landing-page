          id="headline"> Here is a rundown of why he is a mad-dog.</h3>
     
         <li> <strong>1967 </strong>
      He first rose to prominence known with the publication of Hell's Angels, a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang in order to write a first-hand account of lives and experiences of its members.
        </li>
       <li> <strong>1970 </strong>
      He wrote an unconventional magazine feature entitled The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for Scanlan's Monthly which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with counter-culture credibility. 
        </li>
            
               <li> <strong>1970 </strong>
      Politically minded, Thompson ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado on the Freak Power ticket. 
        </li>
      <li> <strong>1971 </strong>
      Thompson remains best known for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a book first serialized in Rolling Stone in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement. 
        </li>
                  <li> <strong>Simply: </strong>
      He was also known for his lifelong use of alcohol and illegal narcotics, his love of firearms, and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism. He often remarked: "I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me."
        </li>
